SwiftIOKitBridge
================

This is a very simple C library to allow Swift to call into a few IOKit and POSIX functions that take variadic arguments. It is solely intended to be used as part of [ORSSerialPort](http://www.github.com/armadsen/ORSSerialPort/).

This is considered a temporarly solution until the Swift Package Manager [implements](https://github.com/ddunbar/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/NNNN-swiftpm-c-language-targets.md) support for C language targets.
